Notice that in this example we are using an ST-Link V2 from other development board. 

We have tried to connect directly the Wio Lite AI via USB without success checking with STM32CubeProgrammer

You can charge the TynyUF2 bootloader:
1.Press 2 buttons on the board at the same time
2.Release just the reset button
3.A new drive will appear in your compute

In theory you can charge UF2 files and change the firmware, but I wasn't able to achieve that
